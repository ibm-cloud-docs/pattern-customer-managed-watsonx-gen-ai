# Overview
{: #overview}

The objective of the customer-managed watsonx Gen AI solution provides a dedicated, single-tenant environment on IBM Cloud, ideal for organizations that need full control over their AI workloads, with a focus on security, customization, and performance. Hosted within a VPC Landing Zone on Red Hat OpenShift, this solution ensures high availability, scalability, and optimal performance, while aligning with IBM Cloudâ€™s best practices.

In summary, the customer-managed, single-tenant watsonx gen AI solution is ideal for enterprises that require full control, heightened security, and customized deployment, while the watsonx SaaS solution is better suited for businesses looking for a more streamlined, managed experience with less operational responsibility. Each approach has its distinct advantages depending on the organization's requirements around control, performance, and complexity.
